# Help page for the resistor calcuation application

## Application's use
The application is used to calculate the value of a resistor from its colors.
By selecting the colors of each band, one can obtain the value of its resistance.

You can choose a particular band by clicking on it, or on the corresponding drop-down menu.
To do this, you must choose a color from the colors offered in each button.
Some bands may have the color "absent", which corresponds to an absence of a band.

Once the colors have been selected, click on the "compute" button and the display of the resistance value is modified.
This value is by default in Ohm, but the unit can be changed using the drop-down menu.

## Menus
###The menu bar allows you to select different options:
- First of all, the "File" tab allows you to quit the application, as well as export a screenshot in PNG format.
  The user can then choose the destination folder and the name of the saved file.

- The "Theme" tab allows you to switch from a light theme to a dark theme, and vice versa.

- It is also possible to change the language of the application.
  Two choices are possible: French or English.
  Changing the language of the application causes the application to restart, resetting any data entered.

- Finally, a "Help" tab provides access to a help page, which you are currently reading.
